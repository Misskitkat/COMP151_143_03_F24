This file was made for the use of students of Bridgewater State University's COMP 151-003 and 004 (of course their PAL sections too).
This is to be used as a reference of the basic python code we show in class and meant to be used to build a project off of for the class.
This code was created by Katie Boscombe, a Computer Science student at Bridgewater State University.

Do not copy code from here for your projects. Use it as a resource.
